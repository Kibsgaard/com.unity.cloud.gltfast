# Bounds / BoundsMissing

## Description

*Bounds* contains meshes with vertex position min/max values that ought to result in non-uniform axis-aligned mesh boundaries.

*BoundsMissing* contains those same meshes, but with vertex position min/max values (partially) missing. That's good for checking if bounds are correctly calculated.
